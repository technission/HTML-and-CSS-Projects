		<p class="My_Style">HTML enties are another way to represent certain characters that you want as just characters.
		For example a less than sign cannot just simply be typed in HTML because the interpreter will
		think it is a part of the code not the content.These characters can be typed by either their entity
		name or entity number. These names and numbers are a predetermined set of letters or numbers with
		an ampersand sign to represent the character. As you can see here I am typing less than using an
		entity name and it is not being interpreted as code. &lt; </p>
		<p>The text shadow property shows a shadow behind each letter of text.</p>
